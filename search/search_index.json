Create (or copy in) new script written in your favourite programming language. Start tracking your file in Git. Make multi-line changes to your code and commit them. Repeat 4th point 2 more times. Revert the changes from the previous commit. Make .gitignore ignore all (make changes 1-by-1 and commit in between): Files in log directory, which can be located in any subdirectory in your repository. Files containing _test in root directory of your repository. Any files with 6, 9, 1 as 2nd character. Demonstrate 3 types of resets. Add remote to your repository. Push your local changes to remote repository. Prepare one question regarding your repo, which can be answered by looking at your git log.","title":"Seminar 1"},{"location":"Seminar2/","text":"Create new (public) repository on GitHub.
